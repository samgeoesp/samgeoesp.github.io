# Blog - Sam Espley

Hi to whoever is reading this! As I am approaching the end of my PhD (September 2024) I thought it would be a good idea to consolidate what I have learnt and what thoughts I have had throughout. This will primarily be for little code snippets and how to's that I think may be useful to someone. Even if they aren't, writing it will be helpful to me!
In the event that this develops into me posting my opinions... ***all opinions and views are my own and are in no way representative of sponsors or employers***.

Now that is out of the way, I have a few ideas of posts but nothing concrete. I suppose things will come to me as I write up and that can be useful to me! 

## About me

I think a lot of people with agree with me that writing about yourself is a labourious task that never truly feels comfortable. Considering that, I will endevaour to keep it short and sweet! I am, *currently*, a final year PhD student at the University of Bath studying computational chemistry. My undergraduate was at the University of Southampton in standard chemistry and I enjoyed it a lot. Originally from Brighton but ended up in Bath via a year in Sweden. As much as I hate it, I may do a post about me in a bit more detail at some point but this is plenty for now!
