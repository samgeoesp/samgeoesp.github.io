# Data Splitting 


This post is inspired by a couple of key papers that I have seen as well as a few discussions online about best practices and how data splitting can really impact a models performance. I am going to do my best to highlight how a few papers split their data and explain the methods as simple as possible. The goal for this post is not to provide a in depth understanding, rather a surface level view for consideration when nexrt splitting your data!
